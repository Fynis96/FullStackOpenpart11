Let's say we went with Python as the language of choice for this team of 6. The project itself being a backend server for some lab curated content, as I have done in the past.  For Python and this project, I would probably use Pytest for the testing suite, I would pair both PyLint for the linting, and Black to format afterwards similar to Prettier, and no build solution required for Python in the CI/CD pipeline. Which is essentially what had occured for the very team I had worked with in the past.
A couple of other CI/CD solutions would be TravisCI and CircleCI, both being cloud based solutions as opposed to Jenkins.
For a small team and a not so large project, I would go with Github Actions for the sake of simplicity and less configuration.  Configuration always seems to be a pain point for many.  If the project and team scaled to a larger size, Jenkins would be the better option over all, lending to more customization and power from personal hardware, and with it being open source the cost of usage for Jenkins itself is free, limited once again by the personal/company hardware put to use.
